# MACRO PAD 

In order to save mere seconds of my life I have spent a long time making my own DIY stream deck. <br />
It was made possible by using an old numpad with Raspberry Pi Pico furthermore  I used AHK scripts for specific apps, and requirements. <br />
To contain the rasbery pi pico so that it does not danggle around I made a 3D printed box that is kept under my desk with small form factor which is cappable of holding the 2 pico model also.  <br />
STL file included. <br />

Refer to [jfedor2's repository](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper) for updated firmware and instructions on how to flash your specific Pico.
