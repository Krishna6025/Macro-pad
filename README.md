# MACRO PAD 

In order to save mere seconds of my life I have spent a long time making my own DIY stream deck.
It was made possible by using an old numpad with Raspberry Pi Pico furthermore  I used AHK scripts for specific apps, and requirements.

Refer to [jfedor2's repository](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper) for updated firmware and instructions on how to flash your specific Pico.
